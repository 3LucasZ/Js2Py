TODO
2. Fix if-elif by removing elif and replacing it with nested if-else
4. Fix regexp literals
5. Fix string/regexp to regexp transformation
6. Fix ?: < worst shit ever. Code runs but has unexpected output :(
7. Fix array elision ( handle None elements in array passed to Js function )
8. Fix increments. Again...

!!!. Run 262 test! I cant run it now because errors and constructors are not implemented yet.
     90% of tests fail because of that.

TODO Maybe
1. Add regexp to NodeVisitor
2. Fix <<= and other operators
3. Speed up NodeVisitor


BUILTINS
todo
1. Array
3. Date
4. JSON
5. RegExp

PARSING PROBLEMS:
1. UNICODE
2. \ line break in strings and to small number of chars in \1 escape
2. Further empty object checks!
3. getters and setters improve detection ( {set:40} is not a setter while {set 40() {}} is )
4. Repair for-in statement :) it has a lot of bugs!
